//* Introduction - JavaScript

//? ** Introduction to JavaScript - Js :**

/* JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language that provides dynamism and
functionality to web pages. Initially developed to improve interactivity in the browser,
Js has become an essential pillar in modern web development. */

//? **Featured Features:**

//* 1. ** Browser Language :**
/* JavaScript is executed by web browsers, allowing developers to create experiences
interactive directly on the client side. */

//* 2. **Interpreted and Weakly Typed:**
/* When interpreted, it does not require a prior compilation process. Weak typing offers flexibility
when working with variables, allowing dynamic type changes. */

//* 3. **Object Oriented:**
/* Although it is based on prototypes, JavaScript follows object-oriented programming principles,
allowing the creation and manipulation of objects. */

//* 4. **Asynchrony and Events:**
/* The ability to handle asynchronous operations and events is essential. This allows the
Applications respond to user actions without blocking code execution. */

//? **Common Uses:**

//* 1. **Frontend Development:**
/* On the client side, JavaScript is used to manipulate the Dom, manage events, and create
interactive user interfaces. */

//* 2. **Backend Development:**
/* With Node.js, JavaScript is extended to the server side, allowing the construction of applications
  complete websites with a single language. */

//* 3. **Frameworks and Libraries:**
/* Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, as well as libraries like jQuery, simplify development
web by providing useful tools and abstractions. */

//* 4. **Mobile Applications:**
/* Thanks to frameworks like React Native, JavaScript is used in the development of mobile applications
multi platform. */
