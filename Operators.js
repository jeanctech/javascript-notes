//* Operators - JavaScript

/* Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Here there is one
description of some common operators in JavaScript: */

//? Arithmetic Operators:

//* 1. **Sum (+):**

let result = 5 + 3; // result is 8

//* 2. **Subtraction (-):**

    let resut = 5 - 3; // result is 2

//* 3. **Multiplication (*):**

    let rest = 5 * 3; // result is 15

//* 4. **Division (/):**

    let res = 6 / 2; // result is 3

//* 5. **Module (%):**

    let resultd = 7 % 3; // result is 1 (remainder of the division of 7 by 3)

//? Assignment Operators:

//* 6. **Assignment (=):**

    let x = 10;

//* 7. **Assignment with Operation (+=, -=, *=, /=):**

    let y = 5;
    and += 3; // is the same as y = y + 3; // and now it is 8

//? Comparison Operators:

//* 8. **Equality (==):**

    let a = 5;
    let b = "5";
    console.log(a == b); // true (value comparison)

//* 9. **Strict Equality (===):**

    let aa = 5;
    let bb = "5";
    console.log(a === b); // false (value and type comparison)

//* 10. **Inequality (!=):**

     let aaa = 5;
     let bbb = 3;
     console.log(a != b); // true (value comparison)

//? Logical operators:

//* 11. **And (&&):**

     if (condition1 && condition2) {
       // code if both conditions are true
     }

//* 12. **Or (||):**

     if (condition1 || condition2) {
       // code if at least one of the conditions is true
     }

//* 13. **Not (!):**

     if (!condition) {
       // code if condition is false
     }

//? Increment and Decrement Operators:

//* 14. **Increment (++) and Decrement (--):**

     let counter = 5;
     counter++; // increment counter by 1 (counter is now 6)
     counter--; // decrement the counter by 1 (counter is now 5 again)

//? Other Operators:

//* 15. **String Concatenation (+):**

     let greeting = "Hello";
     let name = "John";
     let message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"; // "Hello John!"

//* 16. **Ternary Operator (? :):**

     let age = 18;
     let status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult": "Minor"; /* if age is greater than or equal to 18, status is
     "Adult", otherwise it is "Minor" */

/* These are just some of the operators available in JavaScript. Combine and understand how they work
These operators are essential for writing effective and expressive code. */
